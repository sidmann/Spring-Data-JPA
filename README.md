# Spring-Data-JPA
Spring Data JPA repository is a module of the Spring Framework that provides a simple and consistent way to access relational databases using Java Persistence API (JPA). It allows developers to interact with the database using a high-level object-oriented interface, eliminating the need for boilerplate code for common data access tasks such as creating, reading, updating and deleting data. Spring Data JPA repository provides a set of pre-built methods for these tasks and also allows developers to define custom methods for more complex queries. With Spring Data JPA repository, developers can write less code and focus on the business logic of their applications, while still achieving efficient and scalable data access.
